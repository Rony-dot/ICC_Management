// ===== information =====
1. for multiple bean we should use qualifier in @Autowired
2. Use update() if you are certain that the session does not contain an already persistent instance with the
same identifier. Use merge() if you want to merge your modifications at any time without consideration
of the state of the session. In other words, update() is usually the first method you would call in a
fresh session, ensuring that the reattachment of your detached instances is the first operation that
is executed.
